# Colab Notebooks for image background removal

These are Colab notebooks for [U²-Net](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net) and [DIS](https://github.com/xuebinqin/DIS), both by Xuebin Qin et al. All notebooks support batch processing of an entire directory. All notebooks were made to run in Google Colaboratory, using Google Drive as data source and storage.

DIS is more capable imo.

## DIS
